"""
Pure spoken-time formatting — no Home Assistant imports (RM-9, NL-11).

Renders a reminder's start as a natural spoken-language string ("tomorrow at 6 PM")
rather than a raw datetime, so the conversation agent can echo it verbatim instead of
reading an ISO/digit-clock form aloud. Ported from the Jinja in the original
``script.create_reminder`` (scripts.yaml).
