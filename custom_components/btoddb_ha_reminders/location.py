"""
Pure location-reminder logic — no Home Assistant imports (LOC-1, LOC-2).

This module is deliberately HA-free so its tests run under plain pytest, mirroring
``delivery.py``. It owns the location-reminder shape and the zone-transition math: given
a person's old and new state strings and the value a person's state takes while inside a
target zone, decide whether the person just *entered* or *left* that zone.

The HA layer resolves a ``zone.*`` entity_id to the string a person's state takes inside
it (``"home"`` for the home zone, else the zone's friendly name) and passes it in as
``zone_value`` — keeping this module string-only and testable.
